Good Day
My name is Louis, My username is lthabeth. Today was my first day at WeThinkCode_, therefore I put on my best clothes and was looking quite handsome.

The first thing we had to do was to log in to an intranet program called "42". I thought logging in would be eazy, but eish! it wasn't as easy as i thought it would be. After about thirty minutes of copy/pasting and making up passwords I got through it.

This will be difficult because that's how life is but if Lord Geff is with us, we will all get through this and we will have pap and braai at the of all of this.

Yours sincerely
Louis
